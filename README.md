Send "AV" input via IR after the tv power up


My TV is an old Sony one that does'nt support HDMI-CEC and I want to use it with an nvidia shield 2019. The Shied can power up the TV via IR, but the TV doesn't detect the HDMI source, and doesn't switch to the shield.

This programm send the "AV" IR code to the TV after receiving a "power on" code.
